# Astronomy-An-Introduction
Final Project for a class that I wanted to continue working on even after class had ended.

Project was to build a website from scratch. I decided to make one about astronomy and then went way overboard with it. I was unable to complete it 100% during the class timeframe, so here I am building on to it.
